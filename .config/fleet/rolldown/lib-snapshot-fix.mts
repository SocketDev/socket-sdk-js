/**
 * @file Rolldown plugin: apply targeted, BEHAVIOR-PRESERVING lazy transforms to
 *   the handful of `@socketsecurity/lib` dist modules that capture a native
 *   `[Foreign]` handle at MODULE-EVAL, so the snapshot build
 *   (`--build-snapshot`) does not abort with `global handle not serialized:
 *   [Foreign]` → `CheckGlobalAndEternalHandles failed`. SPIKE
 *   (spike/snapshot-hooks) — the LOCAL-PROTOTYPE wiring of the upstream lib
 *   fix. WHY this exists. The full 190-hook snapshot bundle drags two lib
 *   modules that construct `new AsyncLocalStorage()` at module-eval —
 *   `env/rewire.js` (`isolatedOverridesStorage`) and `themes/context.js`
 *   (`themeStorage`). An `AsyncLocalStorage` registers a native async-hook
 *   `[Foreign]` handle V8 refuses to serialize into a startup snapshot. Both
 *   storages are read ONLY inside function bodies
 *   (`getEnvValue`/`withEnv`/`getTheme`/`withTheme`/…), so deferring their
 *   construction to first use is behavior-identical — and that is exactly what
 *   unblocks the env-rewire / theme-context graph for bundle A. HOW. Rather
 *   than mutate the read-only pnpm store or require a populated overlay dir
 *   (the prototype's earlier shape, which silently no-op'd because the overlay
 *   path symlinks back to the store), this plugin reads the store's REAL module
 *   source for the matched file and rewrites just the eager `const X = new
 *   AsyncLocalStorage()` binding into a lazily-initialized accessor — leaving
 *   every other line, export, and behavior untouched. Build-time only; the real
 *   path is the upstream lib release deferring these two constructions, plus a
 *   version bump, after which this plugin goes away. The SDK
 *   (`@socketsecurity/sdk`) inlines its OWN bundled copies of these two lib
 *   modules under `__commonJS` wrappers; those copies are only evaluated when
 *   the SDK calls `require_rewire()` / `require_context()`, which it does NOT
 *   at barrel module-eval — so they stay deferred without this plugin. This
 *   plugin only needs to cover the lib-stable ESM import path that a hook pulls
 *   directly. The lazy SDK client construction (`check-new-deps`) is handled in
 *   the hook itself.
