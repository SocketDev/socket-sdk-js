/*
 * @file Caps how long a single INLINE comment block may run. Per CLAUDE.md
 *   "Default to no comments; when written, for a junior reader" — a comment
 *   earns its place by naming a constraint or a hidden invariant, and past a
 *   point a wall of prose stops being read at all. The long ones in practice
 *   are narration that restates the code beneath, or a design discussion that
 *   belongs in `docs/agents.md/**` where it is searchable and can be linked.
 *
 *   Sized against the windows in `lib/comment-markers.mts`, so they agree
 *   instead of drifting:
 *
 *   - The FILE header gets `MAX_FILE_HEADER_COMMENT_LINES` (20), and that is
 *     the default cap for an INLINE block: it should never out-run the budget
 *     of the whole file's `@file` docblock.
 *   - A DOCUMENTATION block gets `MAX_DOC_COMMENT_LINES` (40). A single
 *     JSDoc `/** *\/` carries API contracts and parser lock-step notes, so
 *     it never needs an allow marker under the budget, and past the budget
 *     the discussion moves to `docs/agents.md/**`.
 *   - An `@example` section is FREE: its lines are subtracted before the
 *     budget is applied. A worked example is sized by the code it shows, not
 *     by how wordy the author was, and capping it only pressures people into
 *     deleting the most useful part of the block.
 *   - A LEADING block sits under `MAX_LEADING_COMMENT_LINES` (12) if it needs
 *     to carry a `socket-lint: allow` marker, since the bypass lookback stops
 *     there. `no-malformed-bypass-marker` reports a marker pushed past it.
 *
 *   The file's own header block is exempt — `max-file-lines` already prices the
 *   whole file, and an `@file` docblock is the sanctioned place for the long
 *   explanation. Reporting only: shortening prose is an authoring call, and the
 *   usual fix is to move the depth into a doc and leave a link.
 *
 *   Bypass: a `oxlint-disable-next-line socket/max-comment-block-lines` marker on the block.
