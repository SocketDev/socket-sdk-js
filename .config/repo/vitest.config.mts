/**
 * @file Vitest configuration. Isolation: the fleet default is `isolate: true` —
 *   each test file gets a fresh module registry + globals, so cross-file
 *   leakage (process.env, path-rewire overrides, vi.mock state, nock
 *   interceptors) is impossible. Correctness by default. A repo that wants the
 *   faster shared-worker mode for a known-safe subset opts those files OUT by
 *   listing globs in a repo-owned `.config/repo/vitest-non-isolated.json` (`{
 *   "include": ["test/unit/pure/**"] }`). When that file exists, those globs
 *   run in a second, non-isolated project and the default isolated project
 *   excludes them. No file → everything isolated.
