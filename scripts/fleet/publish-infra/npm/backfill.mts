/**
 * @file The sanctioned gap-fill backfill gate for the npm publish flow. A
 *   backfill republishes PRIOR content as a version that was skipped between
 *   two already-published versions — 1.4.3 between a live 1.4.2 and 1.4.4.
 *   The normal release path can't reach it: the bump/changelog gate anchors
 *   to registry latest and refuses anything at-or-below it, and a historical
 *   ref can't be dispatched because workflow_dispatch needs npm-publish.yml
 *   to exist on the dispatched ref. So the workflow is dispatched from MAIN
 *   with `checkout-ref` naming the CONTENT and `backfill-version` naming the
 *   gap, the bump stage is bypassed, and the staged publish runs behind five
 *   hard guards that keep the mode gap-fill-only:
 *
 *   1. The version must be absent from the registry `time` map — never published,
 *      and never published-then-unpublished. The time map is the registry's
 *      permanent publish ledger, so it is the one source that can prove
 *      absence; an unreadable ledger fails CLOSED.
 *   2. The version must be LOWER than registry latest. Backfill can only fill a
 *      gap behind history — it is never a way to skip the bump gate forward.
 *   3. The dist-tag must be explicitly non-`latest`. A backfill never moves the
 *      latest pointer.
 *   4. A checkout-ref is required — the workflow definition comes from main, so
 *      the content ref must be named, never implied.
 *   5. The package.json version at the checkout-ref must equal the backfill
 *      version — the content commit declares itself.
