/*
 * @file PUBLISH pipeline — stage a bumped version's package(s) to a registry
 *   (npm / cargo / python), run the pre-approve verify gate, then promote via a
 *   separate explicit `--approve` (browser web-OTP 2FA) that — once the
 *   publish is confirmed live — continues into the release stage: the git tag
 *   + immutable GitHub release, cut LAST as the final marker.
 *
 *   This is the PUBLISH half of the release/publish split. The release
 *   pipeline (release-pipeline.mts) runs the readiness gates through the bump
 *   commit; this pipeline stages the bumped version, verifies it, and its
 *   `--approve` promotes + releases. The two share one state file, so publish
 *   resumes from the recorded target version + a passing `bump` receipt; it
 *   REFUSES when the bump hasn't landed (run the release pipeline first). The
 *   GATE INVERSION is deliberate: publishing never waits on a GitHub release —
 *   the release waits on the publish. The release stage REFUSES without a
 *   passed approve receipt AND without the version being resolvable on the
 *   registry (a STAGED package is not published; staging may never be
 *   approved — the v6.2.0 near-miss cut an immutable release whose publish
 *   then failed on auth). Private / github-release-only packages never run
 *   this pipeline at all.
 *
 *   Channel routing: this pipeline is the `npm-registry` engine (the stage →
 *   verify → approve model is npm's staged-publish flow). The other publish
 *   channels route to their OWN dedicated engines, NOT through here:
 *   `crates-registry` → cargo-publish.mts (its `--approve` is the actual
 *   `cargo publish`, then the same publish-before-release order: registry
 *   liveness, then tag + release), and `go-registry` → go-publish.mts
 *   (a Go module publishes by pushing a semver tag — no registry upload, no
 *   token, no stage/approve — so it has no analog to this flow; see
 *   go-publish.mts). The channel→workflow authority is `PUBLISH_WORKFLOW_BY_FROM`
 *   in sync-scaffolding/socket-wheelhouse-config.mts (`go-registry` →
 *   .github/workflows/go-publish.yml → the `go-publish` CI environment).
 *
 *   Stages: stage-publish (REMOTE-FIRST: dispatches + watches the
 *   npm-publish.yml workflow so the staged upload runs in CI under OIDC —
 *   nothing public yet; `--local` is the explicit offline escape into a
 *   local `pnpm stage publish`) → verify (pre-approve integrity gate;
 *   stashes the release-asset checksums) → approve (explicit, never part of
 *   a run) → release (same invocation as approve, cut LAST).
 *
 *   Tag-gap healing: `--reconcile X.Y.Z` is the stateless registry-truth
 *   reconcile for a version that is already LIVE on the registry but missing
 *   its v* tag + GH release — the gap an npm-UI owner promote leaves behind.
 *   It runs ONLY the registry-truth verify (re-pack at the version's content
 *   commit vs the packument digests) and the release stage; no staging, no
 *   npm auth, no OTP, and divergent bytes fail loud. The release-reconcile
 *   workflow drives it on a cron.
 *
 *   Usage: node scripts/fleet/publish-pipeline.mts [--dry-run] [--approve]
 *          [--status] [--reset] [--tag <dist-tag>] [--local]
 *          [--reconcile X.Y.Z]
