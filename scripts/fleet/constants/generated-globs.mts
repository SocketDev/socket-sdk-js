/*
 * @file Single source of truth for GENERATED / VENDORED paths — trees that are
 *   build output or someone else's source, never hand-written repo source.
 *
 *   One list, consumed by every ignore surface so they can't drift apart:
 *     - lint  — `.config/fleet/oxlint.config.mts` spreads GENERATED_GLOBS into
 *               ignorePatterns.
 *     - test  — `.config/repo/vitest.config.mts` spreads them into `exclude`
 *               (discovery), and `scripts/fleet/test.mts` filters the staged
 *               set through `isGeneratedPath()` before `vitest related` so a
 *               tracked multi-MB generated blob (e.g. a base64-embedded wasm)
 *               can't hang the pre-commit run by being transformed as a graph
 *               input.
 *     - format / git — `.config/fleet/.prettierignore` and `.gitignore` are
 *               static formats; `scripts/fleet/check/generated-globs-are-consistent.mts`
 *               asserts they cover every entry here rather than re-listing it.
 *
 *   Repo-specific generated dirs (e.g. a parser's `pkg-node/`) are added via the
 *   existing per-repo overlays (oxlint `opts.ignorePatterns`, the repo
 *   `.gitignore`), not here — this list is the fleet-general floor.
