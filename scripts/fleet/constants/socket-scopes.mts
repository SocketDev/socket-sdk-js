/*
 * @file Socket-owned package scope patterns that bypass the fleet's soak /
 *   maturity windows. The cooldown (7-day soak on npm `minimumReleaseAge`,
 *   matching `maturityPeriod` on taze, matching GitHub-release soak in
 *   update-external-tools) exists to catch compromised upstream packages before
 *   adoption. Socket-published packages go through our own provenance pipeline
 *   (OIDC trusted publisher, sigstore attestations, manual approve gate) so we
 *   trust them to ship fresh. Fleet-tier (cascaded) so both wheelhouse-only
 *   scripts AND cascaded checks share one canonical list. Consumers:
 *
 *   1. `.config/fleet/taze.config.mts` — `exclude:` for pass 1
 *      (cooldown-respecting) / re-included in pass 2 (immediate-bump).
 *   2. `scripts/repo/update-external-tools.mts` — bypasses GitHub-release soak
 *      when the tool's `repository: 'github:owner/repo'` owner is a SocketDev
 *      org (see `isSocketSourcedRepository`).
 *   3. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `minimumReleaseAgeExclude:` — kept in lockstep with
 *      this list by the sync-scaffolding manifest (which spreads
 *      `SOCKET_PACKAGE_PATTERNS`), since pnpm reads YAML directly and can't
 *      import this module. Keep the lists alphabetized per the fleet
 *      `socket/sort-*` convention.
 *   4. `scripts/fleet/check/soak-excludes-have-dates.mts` — exempts a Socket-owned
 *      scope glob / bare name from the version-pin requirement (third-party
 *      entries must pin `name@version`).
