/**
 * @file Unified check runner — delegates to lint + type + path-hygiene.
 *   Forwards CLI scope flags to the lint script so `pnpm run check --all`
 *   actually runs a full-scope lint (not the default modified-only scope).
 *   `pnpm type` doesn't accept our scope flags, so it's always a full check.
 *   Usage: pnpm run check # lint in modified scope + full type check +
 *   path-hygiene pnpm run check --staged # lint staged + full type + paths pnpm
 *   run check --all # full lint + full type + paths (CI) Byte-identical across
 *   every fleet repo. Sync-scaffolding flags drift.
