/*
 * @file Claude-driveable orchestrator for the socket-lib DOWNSTREAM RELEASE
 *   CASCADE. When `@socketsecurity/lib` publishes a new version, a fixed train
 *   of downstream repos must absorb it and re-release in strict order. This
 *   orchestrator SEQUENCES that train as explicit, resumable, receipt-producing
 *   stages — the same shape as release-pipeline.mts — but it NEVER hand-rolls a
 *   release and NEVER picks a version or approves a staged package. Those are
 *   USER GATES the orchestrator stops at; every release defers to the owning
 *   repo's own `release-pipeline.mts` + `publish-pipeline.mts`.
 *
 *   The cascade, in strict order — each downstream stage HARD-GATES on the
 *   upstream version being actually PUBLISHED on npm before it proceeds, since
 *   `pnpm run update` pulls the published version:
 *
 *   1. wheelhouse-catalog — bump the @socketsecurity/lib catalog pin to the
 *      target, reconcile the -stable alias, dogfood, `pnpm install
 *      --lockfile-only`, assert the catalog checks, land to wheelhouse main.
 *      The target is the ALREADY-PUBLISHED @socketsecurity/lib version, read
 *      from the registry or pinned with `--version`; this orchestrator never
 *      releases socket-lib itself.
 *   2. packageurl-js — `pnpm run update` then release @socketregistry/packageurl-js
 *      via its release-pipeline. STOPS at that repo's bump-stop where the USER
 *      names the version and at staged-approve where the USER approves in the
 *      npm web UI. Gates the next stage on packageurl-js publishing.
 *   3. socket-registry — update socket-lib + packageurl-js, refresh
 *      registry/manifest.json, release @socketsecurity/registry via its
 *      release-pipeline. USER version + staged approve. Gates next on the
 *      published registry version.
 *   4. socket-sdk-js — update socket-lib + packageurl-js, release
 *      @socketsecurity/sdk via its release-pipeline. USER version + staged
 *      approve. Gates next on the published sdk version.
 *   5. socket-cli — for BOTH the v1.x and main branches, `pnpm run update` to
 *      pull the new @socketsecurity/sdk, then push each branch. Push-only, no
 *      release, no user gate.
 *
 *   The downstream DEPENDENCY GRAPH is not redefined here: this driver consumes
 *   RELEASE_CASCADE_GRAPH from lib/release-cascade.mts — flattenObligations for
 *   the per-repo manifest obligation, renderOwedAfterRelease for what a landed
 *   release owes downstream, and computeOwedFollowUps for the settle verdict —
 *   and layers only the resumable release TRAIN on top: the strict stage order,
 *   the published-version gates, and the USER-gate stops.
 *
 *   Receipts live in a state file under
 *   .cache/fleet/socket-lib-cascade/ — never the tracked tree — so
 *   a re-run resumes at the first incomplete stage. It coordinates rather than
 *   races: when another session is mid-release on a downstream repo the
 *   orchestrator detects the in-flight state from that repo's release-pipeline
 *   receipts and does not double-drive.
 *
 *   This file is the CLI shell only. The orchestrator's parts live in
 *   `socket-lib-cascade/`:
 *   - `stages.mts` — the stage table and the pure lookups over it.
 *   - `state.mts` — the receipt model, the state file, and the resume plan.
 *   - `gates.mts` — the published-version and downstream-activity decisions.
 *   - `render.mts` — every banner and table the run prints.
 *   - `commands.mts` — the deferred command sequences and their runner.
 *   - `drive.mts` — the registry, spawn, and filesystem edges plus the run
 *     loop.
 *   - `target.mts` — which published socket-lib version cascades, and the
 *     state file that carries it.
 *
 *   Usage: node scripts/fleet/socket-lib-cascade.mts [--version X.Y.Z]
 *     [--status] [--reset] [--dry-run]
