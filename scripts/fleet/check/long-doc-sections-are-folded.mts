/*
 * @file Long markdown sections carry a `<details>` fold.
 *
 *   THE GOAL IS SCROLL LESS, EXPLORE MORE. A reader should navigate a doc by
 *   opening what they need, not by scrolling past what they do not. A section
 *   that runs past a screen with no fold in it forces the second, and the cost
 *   lands on every future reader rather than the one author who wrote it.
 *
 *   BOTH THRESHOLDS ARE DERIVED FROM A SCREEN, not from a percentile. A
 *   GitHub markdown viewport shows roughly 45 rendered lines. A heading, its
 *   lead prose, and the page chrome take about 15 of those, so:
 *
 *   - MAX_UNFOLDED_LINES (30) — a section body past this pushes the NEXT
 *     heading off screen, which is the moment a reader loses the map of where
 *     they are and starts scrolling to find it.
 *   - MAX_UNFOLDED_CODE_LINES (20) — one fenced block past this fills the
 *     viewport by itself. Code is read by jumping to a line, not top to
 *     bottom, so a long block is the clearest case for folding.
 *
 *   Measured against this repo: at 30 lines, 183 of 591 files carry a section
 *   that needs folding; at 20 lines it is 488, which is most of the corpus and
 *   stops being a signal. On the code side, 8% of the 2206 fenced blocks run
 *   past 20 lines, against 25% past 10 — an 11-line snippet scrolls nothing,
 *   so a limit that low would fold a quarter of every example in the docs.
 *
 *   A fold ANYWHERE in the section satisfies it. The rule asks for a section
 *   that can be navigated, not for a particular shape, and deliberately does
 *   not care which part got folded — the author knows which half is reference
 *   and which is the point.
 *
 *   Bypass: `<!-- wh:fold allow -->` anywhere in the section, for prose that
 *   genuinely has to be read start to finish.
 *
 *   Exit: 0 clean or report-only; 1 when enforcing and a section is unfolded.
