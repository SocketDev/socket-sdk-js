/*
 * @file Commit-time gate: the repo-local coverage badge matches the latest
 *   coverage run. The README references `assets/repo/badges/coverage.svg` (a
 *   generated, optimized SVG — no third-party badge host) and the SVG's
 *   stamped percent must equal the rounded line-coverage total from
 *   `coverage/coverage-summary.json` (the vitest json-summary reporter). The
 *   commit-time twin of `make-coverage-badge.mts --check`; they share
 *   `lib/coverage-badge.mts` so the writer and the gate can't disagree.
 *
 *   Fails-open (exit 0, no finding) when the badge can't be meaningfully checked:
 *     - no README badge in either form (a repo that opted out);
 *     - the badge SVG is still the "n/a" placeholder (seeded, never measured);
 *     - no coverage-summary.json (a lint/type CI lane that didn't run coverage,
 *       or a fresh clone). Coverage drift is caught the moment cover IS run.
 *
 *   Fails loud when:
 *     - the README still carries the retired shields.io badge AND coverage
 *       data exists (run make-coverage-badge to migrate);
 *     - the README references the badge asset but the SVG file is missing or
 *       not a generated badge (broken image in the published README);
 *     - the SVG percent disagrees with the coverage total.
 *
 *   Exit codes: 0 — badge current OR not checkable; 1 — stale/broken (run
 *   `node scripts/fleet/make-coverage-badge.mts`).
