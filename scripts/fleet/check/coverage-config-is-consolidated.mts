/*
 * @file Fail-closed gate: a repo's coverage include/exclude overlay lives in
 *   the ONE settings file, `.config/repo/socket-wheelhouse.json` `coverage`
 *   section, never a standalone `.config/repo/coverage.json`. The canonical
 *   coverage config (.config/fleet/vitest.coverage.fleet.config.mts) reads ONLY
 *   the socket-wheelhouse.json `coverage` section, so a leftover
 *   `coverage.json` is dead config — its include/exclude keys silently do
 *   nothing, and the suite measures a different denominator than the file
 *   claims (the exact false-green shape a 0% that exits 0 rides on). That is
 *   the orphan a cascade strands when the reader is consolidated but a member's
 *   old per-file overlay is left on disk, so this gate makes the orphan fail
 *   loud instead of degrading coverage silently.
 *
 *   config-segregation twin: the one-config-surface rule is the WHY; this
 *   check is the code-is-law enforcement for the specific coverage surface,
 *   mirroring vitest-config-is-consolidated.
 *   Exit codes: 0 — no orphaned coverage.json; 1 — one is present.
 *   Usage: node scripts/fleet/check/coverage-config-is-consolidated.mts [--quiet]
