/**
 * @file Enforce wheelhouse soak-exclude ⊆ EXPECTED_RELEASE_AGE_EXCLUDE. Past
 *   incident (2026-05-31, cascade@4ec6212c): wheelhouse's own
 *   `pnpm-workspace.yaml` listed `@oxc-project/types@0.133.0` in
 *   `minimumReleaseAgeExclude:` because it's a transitive dep of rolldown@1.0.3
 *   that hasn't soaked yet — but `EXPECTED_RELEASE_AGE_EXCLUDE` (the
 *   cascade-canonical list in `scripts/sync-scaffolding/manifest.mts`) was
 *   missing it. Every fleet repo's cascade applied the workspace yaml changes
 *   from elsewhere but didn't inherit this entry, so every downstream `pnpm
 *   install` rejected rolldown@1.0.3's transitive dep with
 *   `[ERR_PNPM_NO_MATURE_MATCHING_VERSION]`. The invariant: **anything
 *   wheelhouse needs to install (its own soak-exclude block) must be in
 *   `EXPECTED_RELEASE_AGE_EXCLUDE` so it propagates to every fleet repo via the
 *   cascade**. Bare names (`@socketsecurity/*` etc.) are already in the
 *   SOCKET_PACKAGE_PATTERNS spread; this check focuses on the versioned entries
 *   (`name@version`) that drift case-by-case. Exit 0 = parity. Exit 1 = drift;
 *   lists the diffs. CI gate via `scripts/check.mts`. Wheelhouse-only — fleet
 *   repos don't have an EXPECTED_RELEASE_AGE_EXCLUDE; the cascade hands them
 *   the synth.
