/**
 * @file Enforce baseline `catalog:` deps ⊆ EXPECTED_CATALOG_ENTRIES ∪
 *   OPTIONAL_CATALOG_ENTRIES. The fleet package.json BASELINE
 *   (checks/package-baseline-is-current.mts → CANONICAL_CATALOG_DEPS, derived
 *   from every devDependency the wheelhouse pins to `catalog:`) is what the
 *   cascade WRITES onto every member's package.json as `"<name>": "catalog:"`.
 *   For that reference to resolve, the cascade must ALSO inject a matching
 *   `catalog:` entry into the member's pnpm-workspace.yaml — and it only injects
 *   the names in EXPECTED_CATALOG_ENTRIES (always) / OPTIONAL_CATALOG_ENTRIES
 *   (when already present). A baseline dep absent from BOTH maps gets the
 *   package.json `catalog:` ref with NO catalog entry, so the member's next
 *   `pnpm install` dies with ERR_PNPM_CATALOG_ENTRY_NOT_FOUND_FOR_SPEC and can
 *   never reconcile.
 *
 *   Past incident: the baseline wrote `@types/semver: catalog:` (plus
 *   @types/node, magic-string, markdownlint, markdownlint-cli2, semver, nock)
 *   onto members while none of those were in EXPECTED/OPTIONAL_CATALOG_ENTRIES
 *   — every member cascade (hit on socket-mcp + socket-registry) installed red.
 *   nock was the subtler shape: it WAS in FLEET_CANONICAL_CATALOG_NAMES but
 *   missing from the version-source template/base/pnpm-workspace.fleet.yaml, so
 *   loadExpectedCatalogEntries() silently skipped it and EXPECTED never carried
 *   it. This gate catches BOTH (a name not in the map, and a name in the map
 *   the version-source drops) because it asserts membership of the RESOLVED
 *   entries, not the raw NAME maps.
 *
 *   The invariant: **EXPECTED_CATALOG_ENTRIES ∪ OPTIONAL_CATALOG_ENTRIES must be
 *   a SUPERSET of the baseline `catalog:` refs** so every `catalog:` the cascade
 *   writes onto a member resolves to a catalog entry the cascade also writes.
 *
 *   Exit 0 = covered. Exit 1 = a baseline dep is uncovered; lists the gaps. CI
 *   gate via scripts/fleet/check.mts. Wheelhouse-only — fleet repos don't ship
 *   the sync-scaffolding manifest; the check no-ops there (the cascade hands
 *   members the resolved catalog, not these maps).
 *
 *   Usage: node scripts/fleet/check/baseline-catalog-deps-are-covered.mts [--quiet]
