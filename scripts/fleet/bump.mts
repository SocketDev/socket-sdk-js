/**
 * @file Release-prep step: derive the next version from the Conventional
 *   Commits since the last release tag, generate the CHANGELOG entry from those
 *   same commits, write `package.json` + `CHANGELOG.md`, and commit `chore:
 *   bump version to X.Y.Z`. The CHANGELOG is DERIVED here, never hand-written,
 *   so it can't drift ahead of the tag (the failure mode that shipped a 6.0.9
 *   entry describing work that landed after the 6.0.9 tag). The tag + GitHub
 *   release are created later, at publish/approve time, by `publish.mts`
 *   (`ensureTagAndRelease`) / the provenance workflow — this step only prepares
 *   the bump commit.
 *   ORDERING INVARIANT (bump-exactly-once): the bump — version + CHANGELOG
 *   section — happens LOCALLY, at release time, exactly once; CI never
 *   re-derives it (the re-entry no-op below refuses a second write). A
 *   section written early in CI while main advanced underneath went stale
 *   (packageurl-js 1.4.5 shipped a changelog missing later commits); deriving
 *   at the moment the release is cut means the section and the released
 *   commits are the same set by construction. The drift check
 *   (check/changelog-is-commit-derived.mts) verifies the committed section by
 *   re-running the SAME `deriveReleaseCommits` path exported here — one
 *   derivation implementation, so generation and verification cannot
 *   disagree. The range anchor never silently widens: see `ReleaseAnchor` in
 *   lib/release-anchor.mts (tag → bump commit → registry publish time, else
 *   stop loud), the shared chain this file binds to the npm registry.
 *   Release flow: node scripts/fleet/bump.mts # version +
 *   CHANGELOG + bump commit git push # land the bump <trigger publish workflow>
 *
 *   # CI: stage publish (OIDC + provenance) node scripts/fleet/npm-publish.mts
 *
 *   --approve # local 2FA promote + tag --write-only writes package.json +
 *   CHANGELOG but skips the commit, for the provenance workflow's CI bump stage
 *   (CI commits them via the GitHub API, since main requires signed commits and
 *   CI has no signing key). Usage: node scripts/fleet/bump.mts [--dry-run]
 *   [--release-as <level>] [--write-only]
