# Worktree hygiene

Finish a code change → **commit it**. Don't end a turn with uncommitted edits, untracked files, or staged-but-uncommitted hunks. A dirty worktree is a half-finished job. The next session, the next agent, or your own future `git checkout` trips over it, and the user cleans up after you.

## Rules

- **After finishing a logical unit of work, commit it.** Use a Conventional Commits message per the _Commits & PRs_ rule. Never leave the working tree dirty between turns.
- **Surgical staging only.** `git add <specific-file>`, never `-A` / `.` (per the _Parallel Claude sessions_ rule). The dirty-worktree rule is no excuse to sweep in files you didn't touch. `git add -f` is forbidden for paths containing `/node_modules/` or `package-lock.json` under `.claude/hooks/*/` or `.claude/skills/*/`. Past incident: a cascading agent ran `git add -f` on node_modules across 6 fleet repos; recovery needed a force-push (enforced by `.claude/hooks/fleet/node-modules-staging-guard/`; bypass: `Allow node-modules-staging bypass`).
- **Stage only when you're about to commit.** Put `git add` and `git commit` on the same line (chained with `&&`) or in the same Bash call. Don't stage as a side-effect of "preparing". Staging belongs at commit time. A turn that ends with staged-but-uncommitted hunks is the failure mode the previous bullet warns against (enforced by `.claude/hooks/fleet/no-orphaned-staging/`).
- **If you can't commit yet** (mid-refactor, tests failing, waiting on the user), say so in the turn summary. The user needs to know the dirty state is intentional. Silent dirty worktrees are the failure mode.
- **`git worktree add` worktrees.** Same rule, sharper. Leave the task-worktree clean (committed + pushed) before `git worktree remove`. Otherwise the removal refuses and the work strands.

## Branch discipline (and the checkout trap)

"Smallest chunks" governs the _commit_, not the _branch_. A fresh branch holds a whole queue of related commits — **one logical change does not mean one commit, and one branch is not one commit.** The `no-branch-reuse-nudge` enforces this: it fires only when you commit onto a branch that already has a **remote upstream** — a shared branch others may have pushed to. It stays silent on the default branch and on a fresh local branch with no upstream. So:

- **Stack related commits on one fresh local branch.** Building a multi-fix queue? Commit each fix onto the same branch, in order. That is correct and expected, not "branch reuse."
- **"Shared" = has a remote upstream.** Only then cut a new branch. A local-only branch is yours to keep committing to.
- **Never `git checkout` / `git switch` to another branch to "start the next chunk."** Switching branches:
  - discards uncommitted working-tree edits (they don't follow you if they conflict), and
  - **reverts commits that live only on the branch you left** — the new branch doesn't have them, so your files snap back to that branch's state.
- **To move a commit between branches, `git cherry-pick` it** — never switch away from work in progress and hope it follows.

Example: mid-queue on a multi-fix branch, `git checkout <default>` to "branch the next fix off the default" reverts the first fix's already-committed source changes — that fix lives only on the abandoned branch — and leaves the working tree on a branch missing it. To move a commit, `cherry-pick` it onto the target — never leave the branch holding the queue.

## The principle

The working tree at end-of-turn should match where the user thinks the work is. "Done" means committed. Anything else is paused, and you announce pauses.

## Parallel sessions amplify the cost

Multiple Claude sessions can target the same checkout: parallel agents, terminals, worktrees on the same `.git/`. Dirty state compounds across them. A `git add -A` from session A sweeps session B's in-flight edits into session A's commit. Surgical staging plus same-call commits removes the race.

## Worktree removal can dangle the main checkout's pnpm links

Creating a `git worktree` can make pnpm relink the **shared store** into that
worktree's path. When the worktree is later removed or pruned, the **main**
checkout's `node_modules` symlinks (for example
`node_modules/@socketsecurity/lib-stable`) are left pointing at the deleted
directory:

```text
node_modules/@socketsecurity/lib-stable -> ../../../<removed-worktree>/node_modules/.pnpm/...
```

Every fleet hook that imports a lib subpath then dies at module resolution:

```text
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package '@socketsecurity/lib-stable'
```

The fix is `pnpm install` in the **main** checkout — it rebuilds the links from
the lockfile, restoring the symlink to the local store (`../.pnpm/...`). Run it
under the pinned Node (see the Node-version rule).

If pnpm wants to purge `node_modules` but there's no TTY, it aborts with
`ERR_PNPM_ABORTED_REMOVE_MODULES_DIR_NO_TTY`. Prefix `CI=true` to allow the
purge (it's the intended clean rebuild):

```sh
CI=true pnpm i
```

The `worktree-remove-relink-nudge` PostToolUse hook nudges this step after a
`git worktree remove` / `git worktree prune`. It's a reminder, never a blocker.

### Throwaway cherry-pick worktrees

A common safe pattern is a throwaway worktree off `origin/<default>` to
cherry-pick + push a single commit (when local `main` has diverged). After
`git worktree remove`-ing it, run `pnpm i` in the main checkout to relink — the
cherry-pick worktree's pnpm install is what stole the link.

### Periodic fleet-wide tidy

`managing-worktrees` Mode 3 prunes spent worktrees in the _current_ repo. The
`tidying-worktrees` skill is the fleet-wide, no-prompt sweep — it iterates the
canonical roster (`cascading-fleet/lib/fleet-repos.txt`) and removes only
provably-spent worktrees across every repo. Engine:
`.claude/skills/fleet/tidying-worktrees/lib/tidy-worktrees.mts`.

Both share one removability predicate (`decideWorktree`): remove ONLY when the
tree is clean AND either (a) the branch is fully merged into `origin/<base>`, or
(b) the branch is gone from the remote AND the worktree is **not ahead** of the
base. The ahead-of-base guard is load-bearing — a workflow's local-only
isolation worktree (`.claude/worktrees/wf_*`) reads as "branch gone from remote"
yet may carry unpushed commits, so pruning on remote-state alone would lose
work. Dirty or ahead-of-base worktrees are always kept.

Two operational notes the engine handles: a worktree containing **submodules**
needs `git worktree remove --force` even when clean (the plain form errors
`working trees containing submodules cannot be moved or removed`); the engine
passes `--force` only after a clean-tree check, so it never discards work. And
after any removal, `pnpm i` in each affected repo's primary checkout relinks the
dangled `node_modules` symlinks.

For background care, drive it on a loop: `/loop 6h /fleet:tidying-worktrees
--fix`. Default invocation is dry-run; `--fix` acts.
