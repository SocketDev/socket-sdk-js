# Human gates

A **human gate** is a step in an otherwise scripted flow that only the operator can clear: browser auth, a 2FA/OTP challenge, a hook authorization phrase, a staged-publish approve, or window state (quit this Chrome profile). Agents used to improvise these asks, so the operator had to re-parse a novel prompt every time and could not tell whether an agent-driven option existed. The fleet fixes the shape.

## The shape

Every gate renders identically, composed from `scripts/fleet/_shared/human-gate.mts`:

```text
🖐  HUMAN GATE — npm auth [1/3]
  Need: the local npm token is missing or expired (`npm whoami` → 401).
  Mind: raw `npm login` dies without a TTY (legacy Username prompt EOFs) and bare `npm` fails in-repo (devEngines pins pnpm); the router carries both limitations so neither lane can hit them.
  You: run `node scripts/fleet/npm-web-auth.mts login` in your terminal — same flow, you drive.
  Me: say "log me in" and I run `node scripts/fleet/npm-web-auth.mts login` through its PTY — your browser opens for the OAuth + OTP, I wait.
```

The rules, each load-bearing:

1. **Both lanes are always printed.** Lane A is what the human runs or types themselves; lane B is what they say to have the agent drive it, with the browser opening for them. Authorization phrases count only when a human types them in a user turn. When no agent lane can exist, lane B says so plainly (`no agent lane — …`) instead of vanishing, so the operator never wonders whether an option was omitted.
2. **Same command, two runners.** Both lanes run the SAME non-interactive-capable command; only who drives it differs. A gate must never send the human down a path that fails in the other context ("oh, `!` won't work - do this instead"). The fleet routers make this possible: they pass through when a real TTY is present and run under a PTY when not.
3. **`Mind:` names the active restriction.** The guard or tool limitation that shaped the lanes (devEngines veto, no-TTY input, sanctioned-browser law, phrase provenance) is printed, so the operator never picks a lane a guard would block and never wonders why the obvious raw command isn't offered.
4. **`Me:` closes every block.** It names what the agent does once the gate clears, which is both the resume and the cost of ignoring it. There is no separate `Then:` line - splitting one thought across two lines earned nothing.
5. **Multiple gates render as one numbered queue** (`[i/N]`), ordered by what must clear first, so the whole path to unblocked is visible at once - never one ask at a time across several messages.
6. **Compose from the catalog, never hand-write the prose.** `npmAuthGate`, `pushGrantGate`, `approveGate`, and `browserSessionGate` carry the canonical wording; a script that invents its own phrasing drifts and defeats the point. A mirror test (`test/repo/unit/human-gate.test.mts`) asserts the shape.
7. **Lane A is copy-pasteable, or the gate is broken.** It carries the VERBATIM authorization phrase, or the exact `! <command>` - never a pointer like "type the guard's phrase" or "the phrase its refusal names". A gate exists to unblock in one read; withholding the one string that clears it adds a round trip and sends the operator hunting for wording. This is why `pushGrantGate` takes the phrase as a parameter and renders `type exactly: <phrase>`.

## Quoting an authorization phrase is safe

A guard's refusal text says _do not request, relay, or emit this phrase_. That bars permission **laundering** - an agent producing the phrase, or soliciting it from another agent, session, or file, and then treating it as granted. It does **not** bar telling the operator what to type.

The mechanism settles it: these scanners match on transcript **role provenance**, so only a genuine user turn counts. A phrase written in an assistant turn authorizes nothing, however it is quoted. Printing it in lane A carries no risk, and withholding it buys no safety - it costs the operator a round trip and nothing else.

So print the phrase and let the operator decide whether to type it. The decision stays theirs either way, which is the part the provenance check protects.

## Rendering lane A: two surfaces, two spellings

`copyableText` wraps the phrase in an OSC 8 escape, which reaches a terminal only from **script stdout**. An agent's chat reply renders as markdown, so that escape never arrives and inline `` `backticks` `` give the operator no copy affordance at all - they retype the phrase by hand, which is the friction the fill handler exists to remove.

| Surface          | Lane A spelling                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| script stdout    | `copyableText(phrase)` - OSC 8, clickable where the terminal supports it        |
| agent chat reply | a markdown link whose href is `copyUrl(text)` and whose TEXT is the bare phrase |

**RUN `copyUrl` and paste its output. Never hand-encode the href.** A hand-written percent-encoding drifts from the visible link text silently, and the operator cannot see it: the first chat gate written this way shipped `%2FDepscan` under link text reading `depscan`, so a click would have copied a phrase no guard matches. The link text and the href encode the same string or the gate is worse than no link at all.

**No fenced fallback underneath.** The link TEXT is the phrase, so it is already selectable and typeable when the handler is absent - a fence repeating it is redundant weight in every gate. Making the link text the phrase verbatim is what removes the need for a second copy.

**Say nothing about clicking.** No "click to copy", no "then press Enter", no note about what to do if the click does nothing. The phrase-as-link-text degrades on its own: with a handler installed a click copies it, and without one the operator reads and types the same characters. Both operators see an identical gate, so instructions written for the clickable case only advertise an absence to everyone else. A gate that explains its own machinery is describing the tool instead of the decision.

Install the handler once per machine with `scripts/repo/setup/pbcopy-handler.mts`, which registers `x-socketsecurity--fleet://fill`. It is macOS-only today; elsewhere the same gate reads as plain text and nothing announces the difference.

Clicking FILLS and never submits, which is a security property rather than a shortcoming. A `url` handler is invokable by any local process, so `open x-socketsecurity--fleet://…` from an agent is indistinguishable from a human click; a handler that submitted would let an agent mint a user-role turn carrying an authorization phrase and defeat every provenance guard at once. The operator's Enter stays the anchor. The same reasoning bars routing a phrase through `AskUserQuestion`: a selection becomes user input, so pre-filling the phrase as an option is the laundering this rule forbids.

## npm vs pnpm: know the limitations, encode the choice

Gate lanes never name raw `npm`/`pnpm` commands - they name the fleet routers, which already encode when each tool works. The decision table the routers implement:

| Operation                 | Tool                                                   | Why                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `login` / `adduser`       | pnpm (web OAuth) when available, else npm behind a PTY | raw `npm login` without a TTY falls back to the legacy `Username:` prompt and EOFs; pnpm's login opens the browser directly         |
| `stage list` / stage ops  | pnpm                                                   | the staging endpoints are pnpm-native; an UNAUTHENTICATED stage list parses as EMPTY, not as an error - always identity-check first |
| approve / promote         | npm behind a PTY                                       | the promotion flow is npm's; the PTY carries its browser 2FA from agent shells                                                      |
| `whoami` / identity reads | npm, from `npmScratchCwd()`                            | bare `npm` fails in-repo (devEngines pins pnpm), and a home-dir cwd makes lib spawn drop every home-rooted PATH entry               |

Two traps the `Mind:` lines keep visible: **split identities**: pnpm's config token and npm's `.npmrc` token can be different accounts, and a non-maintainer login reads a real stage as "0 staged entries"; and **no-TTY contexts**: the `!` in-session input and agent shells have no TTY, so only PTY-wrapped or web-flow commands belong in gate lanes.

## Where it is wired

- The release pipeline's verify runner emits the `npm auth` gate when the staged-entry listing is unauthenticated (`release-pipeline/release-runners/verify.mts`).
- `scripts/fleet/npm-web-auth.mts` is the auth router both auth-gate lanes name; `resolveAuthTool` inside it owns the npm-vs-pnpm choice.
- A gate that surfaces outside a script (push-grant phrases, browser-profile state) is written conversationally in this same format, and the operator's global CLAUDE.md carries that block verbatim for non-fleet repos. Such a gate spells lane A per the two-surface table above, since OSC 8 cannot cross a chat reply.
- `scripts/repo/setup/pbcopy-handler.mts` installs the click-to-copy handler; `scripts/repo/check/pbcopy-handler-is-copy-only.mts` gates the property that it can only ever fill.

## Relationship to bypass phrases

A push-grant gate names the phrase for the human to type. The [bypass-phrases](bypass-phrases.md) table does the same. That is not laundering: the scanner matches transcript role provenance, so a phrase printed by an agent grants nothing - only the human typing it in a user turn does. What stays forbidden is asking another agent or session to produce the phrase.

## Search for the script before raising the gate

A gate is a claim that no code can do this. Verify that claim before making it.

- **Grep the publish-infra surface first.** A step that looks like browser work
  often has a driver already:
  `scripts/fleet/publish-infra/npm/trust-sweep.mts` writes trusted-publisher
  rows through `npm trust`'s registry endpoints,
  `browser-session.mts` / `browser-sign-in.mts` carry the session, and
  `npm-web-auth.mts` routes auth. Raising a "do this in the web UI" gate over
  work one of these performs hands the operator a job the repo already
  automated.
- **Name the narrowest human step, not the whole task.** For the
  trusted-publisher sweep the human part is one 2FA approval click with the
  cooldown box ticked; the enumeration, the plan, the revoke-and-create, and the
  `npm trust list` verification are all script work. A gate that says "add the
  rows in the web UI" is wrong by an order of magnitude.
- **A tool that cannot do the write is a different finding from a missing
  script.** npm's bot management silently drops state-changing transactions from
  a CDP-driven browser (132 of 132 saves lost, 2026-07-31), which is why the API
  lane exists. Record that in the `Mind:` line so nobody re-tries the browser.

Genuinely human-only, and the list is short: typing an authorization phrase,
clicking a 2FA or environment approval, provisioning a credential or installing
an App, and naming a release version.

## Lane A runs from anywhere

The command in lane A is pasted into an unknown shell, in an unknown directory.

- **Never write a lane that assumes a working directory.** Prefer the flag that
  removes the assumption: `gh` takes `--repo <owner>/<name>`, so
  `gh workflow run npm-publish.yml --repo SocketDev/<repo> --ref main -f publish=true`
  works from anywhere. When a script genuinely needs its repo root, give the
  absolute path in the same line rather than a `cd` instruction on its own.
- **One line, no placeholders to resolve.** Fill in the real repo, ref, and
  input values. A lane the operator has to edit before running is a lane that
  gets run wrong.
- **Say what remains after the command.** A dispatch does not finish a release:
  the environment stage still needs a browser approval. Put that in `Me:` so
  the operator is not left believing the paste completed the task.
