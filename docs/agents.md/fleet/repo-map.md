# Repo-map — orient by skeleton, read the span

Re-reading context across turns is the dominant model-spend surface: a whole-file
read accumulates in context and is re-read on every later turn. Repo-map is the
retrieval substrate that answers it — orient by a token-cheap symbol skeleton,
then read only the one line span you actually need.

## The engine

`scripts/fleet/make-repo-map.mts` emits a symbol skeleton for a file or
directory: one header line per file plus one line per top-level symbol,
`Lstart-Lend  <signature>`. Deterministic and read-only apart from `--write`.

```sh
# Print a skeleton to stdout.
node scripts/fleet/make-repo-map.mts <file|dir> [<file|dir>…]
# (Re)build the on-disk cache.
node scripts/fleet/make-repo-map.mts --write .
# Refresh only git-touched files.
node scripts/fleet/make-repo-map.mts --write --changed
```

Default mode prints the skeleton to stdout with a `source → skeleton` savings
summary on stderr (on the shared hook libs the skeleton is ~8% of source size).
Model-agnostic — it is the substrate the "RAG + repo-map" retrieval answer points
at, not a Claude-only tool.

## The cache

`--write` persists each file's skeleton to `.repo-map/<relpath>.skel`, mirroring
the source tree, plus a greppable `.repo-map/index.txt` roll-up (every file with
its line/symbol counts + the aggregate savings). Flags:

- `--changed` — only (re)skeleton git-touched sources (tracked diff vs `HEAD` +
  untracked); the cheap incremental refresh. Skips the index rewrite so a partial
  pass never clobbers the full index with a sparse one.
- `--out <dir>` — cache dir (default `.repo-map`).

`.repo-map/` is **gitignored and generated** — it belongs to the gh-release
bundle, never the byte-identical commit cascade. It never needs hand-editing;
it is always regenerable from source.

## The workflow

1. `/map <path>` (the fleet `map` skill, a thin wrapper over the engine) — or run
   the engine directly. To seed/rebuild the whole cache, run the saved
   `refresh-repo-map` workflow (full `--write .` build + a coverage/top-savings
   report).
2. Read the skeleton — a fresh `.repo-map/<file>.skel` when the cache is warm,
   else generate one — to find the symbol and its span.
3. Read ONLY that span with `offset`/`limit` (a symbol at `201-253` →
   `Read(file, offset=201, limit=53)`). A full read stays correct only when you
   are about to edit the file and need exact surrounding bytes.

## Wired into the harness

Two hooks make the cache actually get used, not just exist:

- `read-orientation-nudge` (PreToolUse, advisory — never blocks) fires when a
  whole-file `Read` of a LARGE source file (≥6 KB, no `offset`/`limit`) is about
  to land. When a **fresh** cached skeleton exists (`.repo-map/<rel>.skel`, mtime
  at/after the source's) it points straight at that ready-made file; otherwise it
  suggests `make-repo-map --write`. It skips scoped reads, small files, non-source
  files, and unreadable paths — a full read is still correct when you need exact
  byte context for an edit.
- `repo-map-refresh` (SessionStart, fail-open) detached-spawns `--write
  --changed` at session start to keep the cache warm, but only when `.repo-map/`
  already exists — a fresh clone pays no first-build; seed it once via the
  `refresh-repo-map` workflow.

## Tiering

Engine, skill, workflow, and both hooks are fleet-tier — cascaded to every member
so the orient-first discipline holds fleet-wide. The engine is the single owner;
the skill and hooks are thin wrappers that defer to it. Fix parsing/behavior in
`make-repo-map.mts`, not in the wrappers.
