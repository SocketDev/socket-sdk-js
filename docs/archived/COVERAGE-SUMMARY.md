# Test Coverage Analysis - Executive Summary

**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Project:** @socketsecurity/sdk v2.0.0
**Analysis Tool:** Vitest with V8 coverage provider

---

## 📊 Current Coverage Status

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Lines | 94.08% | 96% | ❌ **-1.92%** |
| Statements | 94.08% | 96% | ❌ **-1.92%** |
| Functions | 96.74% | 100% | ❌ **-3.26%** |
| Branches | 93.99% | 93% | ✅ **+0.99%** |

**Coverage fails CI thresholds** - Needs improvement to meet quality standards.

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Strengths ✅
- **8 of 11 files** at 100% coverage (constants, utils, testing helpers, file-upload)
- **Excellent utility coverage** - All helper functions fully tested
- **Strong validation testing** - 69 tests covering input validation
- **Comprehensive API method tests** - 60 tests for standard API operations
- **Good branch coverage** - 93.99% exceeds 93% threshold

### Gaps ❌
1. **socket-sdk-class.ts** - 92.09% (112 uncovered lines)
   - Missing: Error response handling, streaming operations, sendApi method
2. **http-client.ts** - 90.58% (16 uncovered lines)
   - Missing: ResponseError edge cases, empty response handling
3. **quota-utils.ts** - 96.74% (4 uncovered lines)
   - Missing: File system error paths

## 🚀 Recommended Action Plan

### Priority 1: Quick Wins (2-3 hours → +3% coverage)
Add tests for:
- ✏️ `sendApi` method (completely untested)
- ✏️ HTTP error status codes (401, 403, 5xx)
- ✏️ `getApi` with `throws: false` option
- ✏️ ResponseError constructor edge cases

**Impact:** Covers 75 lines, reaches ~97% coverage

### Priority 2: Streaming Operations (2 hours → +1.5% coverage)
Add tests for:
- ✏️ `streamOrgFullScan` with file/stdout output
- ✏️ `streamPatchesFromScan` NDJSON parsing
- ✏️ Stream error handlers

**Impact:** Covers 35 lines, reaches ~98% coverage

### Priority 3: Edge Cases (1 hour → +0.5% coverage)
Add tests for:
- ✏️ Entitlement validation filters
- ✏️ Quota utils file system errors
- ✏️ Empty/malformed responses

**Impact:** Covers 17 lines, reaches ~98.5% coverage

---

## 📈 Expected Outcome

**Total Effort:** ~5-6 hours of focused work
**New Test Code:** ~200 lines across 4 new test files
**Result:**
- Lines: 94.08% → **97-98%** ✅
- Functions: 96.74% → **100%** ✅
- Statements: 94.08% → **97-98%** ✅
- Branches: 93.99% → **95%+** ✅

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

**Why is coverage at 94% instead of 96%?**

1. **Error Handling Focus** (70% of gaps)
   - Most untested code is in error response handling
   - Structured error body parsing never triggered
   - 5xx server errors not simulated in tests
   - 401/403 retry behavior not tested

2. **Feature Gaps** (25% of gaps)
   - `sendApi` method completely untested
   - Streaming operations have zero coverage
   - `throws: false` option never used in tests

3. **Edge Cases** (5% of gaps)
   - Constructor parameter fallbacks
   - Missing properties in responses
   - File system errors

**Root Cause:** Test suite focuses on success paths and common errors, but misses defensive error handling and alternative API method signatures.

## ✅ What's Already Great

The codebase demonstrates **excellent testing practices**:
- ✨ Comprehensive test helpers for consistent testing
- ✨ Well-organized test structure by feature area
- ✨ Extensive use of mocking (nock) for HTTP requests
- ✨ Good coverage of validation and business logic
- ✨ Isolated tests with proper setup/teardown
- ✨ 22 test files covering different aspects

**The foundation is solid** - just needs targeted additions for error paths.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Review** the three detailed analysis documents
2. **Prioritize** Phase 1 tasks (highest impact/effort ratio)
3. **Implement** tests incrementally with coverage checks
4. **Verify** thresholds pass after each phase
5. **Maintain** coverage with CI enforcement
