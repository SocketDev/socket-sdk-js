# Per-repo weekly + daily dependency update — gh-aw agentic workflow. Source of
# truth: this .md. Edit it, then `gh aw compile` → weekly-update.lock.yml (commit
# BOTH + .github/aw/actions-lock.json). Cascaded to every fleet member; each repo
# runs its own scheduled copy — no shared reusable, no socket-registry delegator.
#
# Two cadences share ONE workflow: the Monday cron runs the full /updating
# umbrella; the daily cron runs /updating-daily (promote soaked exclusions only).
# The stronger get-green workflow is dispatched on a test failure.
#
# Wins over the legacy claude --print reusable: per-run + 24h AI-credit budget,
# firewall egress allowlist, safe-output PR (GitHub web-flow-signed + atomic via
# git-bundle — no BOT_GPG plumbing).

  # Dated snapshot id ON PURPOSE — do not "simplify" back to the bare alias.
  # Anthropic's live /v1/models lists Haiku 4.5 only in dated form, so the bare
  # `claude-haiku-4-5` never direct-matches in the AWF api-proxy model resolver
  # and every request falls through to token steering's middle-power MEDIAN of
  # the live model list. That median silently served claude-opus-4-8 for weeks,
  # then broke fleet-wide on 2026-07-25 when Anthropic added claude-opus-5 to
  # the live list: the median shifted onto an id absent from AWF's frozen
  # ai-credits pricing table and, with max-ai-credits set and no default
  # pricing, every first model request 400'd (unknown_model_ai_credits). The
  # dated id direct-matches, prices at haiku rates ($1/$5 per Mtok) in the AWF
  # table, and keeps this workflow on the tier the routing doctrine assigns
  # (haiku = mechanical). It is also registered in
  # scripts/fleet/constants/model-pricing.json via update-model-pricing.mts so
  # the gh-aw-workflow-models-are-canonical gate recognizes it.

# Dependency update

You are an automated CI agent running the fleet's dependency update. The workflow
reaches this step only when its deterministic gate already found actionable
updates, so proceed without re-checking that.

## Cadence

Two schedules share this workflow. The cadence for this run is
`${{ needs.check_updates.outputs.cadence }}`:

- **`daily`:** run the `/updating-daily` skill only — promote soaked
  `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` entries whose 7-day soak has cleared, then reconcile
  the lockfile. No npm bumps. Title the PR `promote soaked exclusions
(<YYYY-MM-DD>)`.
- **`weekly`:** run the `/updating` umbrella — npm dependencies, lockstep
  manifest, submodules, and workflow pins. Title the PR `weekly dependency update
(<YYYY-MM-DD>)`.

If that cadence value is not exactly `daily` or `weekly` — for instance it still
reads as an unresolved GitHub Actions template expression — stop and report it
with the `missing_data` tool. Never guess the cadence or infer it from the clock
or the repository state: the two cadences open different pull requests, so a
guess ships the wrong change.

## Steps

1. Run the cadence-appropriate skill above. Work in CI mode: skip builds/tests
   during the update. Make **atomic commits** (one logical change per commit) so
   the PR history is reviewable. Do NOT push or open a PR yourself — the
   workflow's safe outputs handle that.

2. Build the project if it has a `build` script, then run its tests:

   ```bash
   pnpm run build   # skip if the repo has no build script
   pnpm test
   ```

3. **If tests pass:** open a pull request via the `create_pull_request` safe
   output, titled per the cadence above. Body: a short intro naming the skill that
   ran, then a `<details><summary>View commit history</summary>` block with the
   commit list.

4. **If tests fail:** do NOT open a PR. Call the `dispatch_get_green` tool with
   the branch and the last 100 lines of the failing build and test logs, so the
   stronger model attempts the fix in the dispatched `get-green` workflow.
