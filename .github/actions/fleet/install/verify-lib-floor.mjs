/**
 * @file @socketsecurity/lib floor verification for the fleet install action.
 *   Decision core extracted from the inline bash `run:` block of the
 *   "Verify @socketsecurity/lib resolvable and >= floor version" step — the
 *   two `node -e` package.json probes, the lib-stable → lib alias fallback, the
 *   HARDCODED_FLOOR vs live npm-view floor comparison, and the banner-string
 *   validation. Branch shape, byte-identical stdout/stderr/exit to the old
 *   step:
 *
 *   - probe @socketsecurity/lib-stable FIRST: a repo whose PRODUCT pins or
 *     bundles an older @socketsecurity/lib — e.g. a backfill content ref
 *     rebuilding historical dist — decouples fleet tooling from that product
 *     pin via the -stable alias, the same indirection every fleet script
 *     imports through. The floor applies to whichever copy fleet tooling will
 *     actually import. A probe that resolves but reports a non-string or empty
 *     version counts as absent — exactly like the old
 *     `process.stdout.write(require(...).version)` probe, where write() threw
 *     on non-strings and the catch wrote ''.
 *   - neither package resolvable → the not-resolvable refusal on stderr, exit 1.
 *   - floor selection: NPM_LATEST — the live `npm view @socketsecurity/lib
 *     version` result, queried by the thin action step and passed via env — is
 *     the ideal floor when it is plain semver. Socket Firewall and other npm
 *     proxies sometimes intercept queries and return a banner string, which
 *     would otherwise poison the comparison — a non-semver response falls back
 *     to HARDCODED_FLOOR and names the banner, truncated to 80 chars like the
 *     old ${NPM_LATEST:0:80}; an empty response falls back and names the failed
 *     query.
 *   - a non-semver installed version → the defensive refusal on stderr, truncated
 *     to 200 chars like the old ${ACTUAL_VERSION:0:200}, exit 1.
 *   - floor comparison is major.minor.patch only, pre-release ignored —
 *     5.24.0-rc.1 satisfies a 5.24.0 floor, same as the semver.mjs `lt` mode
 *     the old step shelled out to; that helper is retired with this extraction
 *     and its regex + compare now live here.
 *   - documented divergence from the old step: the action's npm-view probe now
 *     runs BEFORE resolvability is known, so the not-resolvable failure path
 *     performs one extra npm query, bounded to 10s. Streams and exit codes are
 *     unaffected — proven old-vs-new side-by-side across 17 fixture scenarios.
 *   - co-located with the action and invoked via $GITHUB_ACTION_PATH so it
 *     travels when a member consumes the action — same shape as
 *     github-status-check's probe-github-status.mjs. Dependency-free on
 *     purpose: only `node:` builtins, runnable on the runner's system Node.
 *     Pure decision functions are exported for the wheelhouse unit suite; the
 *     thin CLI shell at the bottom reads NPM_LATEST from the env, probes the
 *     consumer repo's node_modules from the working directory, and exits
 *     non-zero on refusal. Usage: NPM_LATEST=<npm view output> node
 *     verify-lib-floor.mjs
