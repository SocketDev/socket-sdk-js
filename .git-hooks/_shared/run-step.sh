# Shared pre-commit step runners, sourced by .git-hooks/fleet/pre-commit so the
# error-visibility + budget-bounding logic lives in ONE place.
#
# STAYS .sh, NOT .mts. The fleet writes TypeScript everywhere above the node
# boundary; this file sits below it. Two reasons it cannot move:
#   1. The hook dispatchers are pure POSIX sh and SOURCE this file, so its
#      functions have to exist in the caller's shell. A node script cannot
#      export a shell function back to its parent.
#   2. It bounds a step and, on timeout, kills the whole PROCESS GROUP —
#      the sfw pnpm-shim plus every descendant. That is job-control, which
#      the shell owns.
# Its own callee, resolve-node.sh, is what puts node on PATH in the first
# place, so this layer runs before `node` is reliably callable.

# V8 bytecode cache for every step this file runs. Node caches the compiled
# form of each module it loads and reuses it on the next spawn, and a commit
# spawns the same lint and test entrypoints over and over.
#
# THE ONE PLACE the fleet names this directory. `.claude/hooks/fleet/index.cjs`
# calls enableCompileCache() with no argument so it inherits this value rather
# than repeating the literal; anything else that wants the cache reads
# NODE_COMPILE_CACHE too. Node keys entries by source path, so one directory
# shared across checkouts is correct rather than merely tolerable.
#
# In os.tmpdir(), not the repo: scratch never goes in the tracked tree, and a
# temp path cannot write a stray cache into the cascade payload.
#
# Measured on this repo it is a wash - a warm staged test run came out
# indistinguishable from an uncached one, because vitest's cost is vite
# transform and worker spawn rather than JS compile. It stays because it costs
# nothing, and the balance shifts as more of a step's work becomes plain module
# loading.

# tail it on failure with a clear marker so the operator (or agent)

# timeout, KILLS THE WHOLE PROCESS GROUP (the `sfw` pnpm-shim wrapper + every
# oxlint/vitest worker it spawned) — then fails OPEN (returns 0). EVERY heavy
# optional step (lint AND test) runs through this, so the whole optional phase
# is hard-bounded: with the staged scope (lint + test both act only on the
# changed files — no whole-tree escalation), a small commit finishes in a few
# seconds, and the budget is the hang ceiling that keeps a deadlock (e.g. the
# Socket Firewall sfw proxy + a worker blocking on each other) from ever hanging
# the commit past PRECOMMIT_STEP_BUDGET_S. A real lint/test FAILURE (clean
# non-zero before the budget) still BLOCKS the commit — only a budget-exceeding
# HANG is skipped, and the pre-push `--all` gate + CI run the full suite. The
# ceiling is enforced by scripts/fleet/check/precommit-steps-are-bounded.mts,
# which fails if a heavy step is invoked un-bounded or the budget drifts above
# its cap.
