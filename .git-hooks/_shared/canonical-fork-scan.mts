/*
 * @file Commit-time backstop for the fleet-fork rule. A fleet-canonical path
 *   (per .gitattributes `linguist-generated=true`) lives only in `template/`
 *   and is cascaded out via sync-scaffolding, which commits with
 *   `--no-verify` — a legitimate cascade commit never reaches this hook.
 *   Anything staged on a canonical path here was written outside the
 *   cascade: an Edit/Write/Bash tool call, a background Workflow `agent()`
 *   subagent (whose Bash reaches PreToolUse with the PARENT transcript, so
 *   the `no-fleet-fork-guard` PreToolUse hook cannot attribute or block it —
 *   see docs/fleet/agents.md/agent-delegation.md), or a hand-run git command.
 *   A git hook fires for every commit regardless of which process or agent
 *   ran `git commit`, so this closes the gap the tool-call guard cannot
 *   reach.
 *
 *   Reuses the exact decision inputs `no-fleet-fork-guard` already uses
 *   (fleetCanonicalEntries / isPerRepoMarkerPath / isOperatorLocalPath /
 *   textHasFleetBlockMarkers) from
 *   .claude/hooks/fleet/_shared/{fleet-fork,fleet-markers}.mts, so the two
 *   enforcement points can never disagree about what counts as canonical.
