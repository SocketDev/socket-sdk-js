description: Install Socket Firewall (SFW) + AgentShield (AI scanner) + Zizmor (GH Actions scanner) for local security scanning
---

Set up all Socket security tools for local development.

## What this sets up

1. **AgentShield** — scans Claude config for prompt injection and secrets
2. **Zizmor** — static analysis for GitHub Actions workflows
3. **SFW (Socket Firewall)** — intercepts package manager commands to scan for malware

## Setup

First, ask the user if they have a Socket API token for SFW enterprise features.

If they do:

1. Ask them to provide it
2. Write it to `.env.local` as `SOCKET_API_TOKEN=<their-token>` (create if needed). The deprecated `SOCKET_API_KEY` name is also accepted as an alias for one cycle, but new files should use `SOCKET_API_TOKEN`.
3. Verify `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` — if not, add it and warn

If they don't, proceed with SFW free mode.

Then run:

```bash
node .claude/hooks/fleet/setup-security-tools/index.mts
```

After the script completes, add the SFW shim directory to PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.socket/_wheelhouse/shims:$PATH"
```

## Notes

- Safe to re-run (idempotent)
- AgentShield needs `pnpm install` (it's a devDep)
- Zizmor is cached at `~/.socket/zizmor/bin/`
- SFW binary is cached via dlx at `~/.socket/_dlx/`
- SFW shims are shared across repos at `~/.socket/_wheelhouse/shims/`
- `.env.local` must NEVER be committed
- `/update` will check for new versions of these tools via `node .claude/hooks/fleet/setup-security-tools/update.mts`
