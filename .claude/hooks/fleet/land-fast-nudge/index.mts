// Claude Code Stop hook — land-fast-nudge.
//
// Fires at turn-end. When the current checkout is ON the default branch
// (main / master) and local HEAD has DIVERGED from origin (it is BOTH
// ahead AND behind origin/<branch>), it nudges toward the fast-land path
// instead of a hand-rolled cherry-pick + force dance.
//
// Why: a diverged default branch is the state where a direct `git push`
// is rejected (non-fast-forward) and a `reset --hard origin/<branch>`
// would discard local work. It happens routinely in a parallel-session
// fleet: another session squashes your commits onto origin via PR (so
// origin gained commits your local doesn't have as the same SHAs), while
// your local kept the unsquashed originals. Hand-resolving this — manual
// cherry-pick onto a fresh worktree, verify fast-forward, push — is the
// exact friction the `managing-worktrees land` engine (lib/land.mts)
// automates: it re-asserts the lint gate (the fleet lints as it edits, so
// no heavy re-run), cherry-picks onto a throwaway origin/<base> worktree,
// and fast-forwards (never force). This reminder points there at the turn
// the divergence is visible.
//
// Only fires on the default branch when BOTH ahead AND behind: an
// ahead-only main is the unpushed-main-nudge's job (just push); a
// behind-only main just needs a pull; the diverged case is the one the
// fast-land path exists for.
//
// Exit codes: 0 — always (informational Stop hook). Fails open.
