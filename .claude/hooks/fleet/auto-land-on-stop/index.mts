// Claude Code Stop hook — auto-land-on-stop.
//
// Fires at turn-end. Groups THIS session's authored source changes into logical
// commits and lands them to local main, in EVERY repo the session touched
// (started in one repo, moved to another, both get their own commits). The
// fleet biases toward landing often: banked work survives compaction, and a
// clean tree is far less ambiguous to the next session's collision heuristics.
//
// Safety (own-work only; the pre-mortem's blocking flaws are all closed here +
// in land-work):
//   - Repos + paths come from the session touched-set (Edit/Write + git
//     add|mv|rm in the transcript), so a FOREIGN staged feature in the shared
//     index is never swept in. A repo the session only READ never enters.
//   - Each repo is landed by shelling the tested `scripts/fleet/land-work.mts
//     --commit <session-authored repo-relative paths>` with cwd=<repoRoot>. That
//     restricts to the passed paths AND skips generated / both-touched (concurrent
//     index+worktree, which a `git add` would blend) / unmerged-conflict paths,
//     and lands clean source even mid-rebase.
//   - Each commit passes that repo's own pre-commit gate (broken code caught).
//     The staged run is scoped `related` (not full-suite) so turn-end stays fast.
//   - Fail-open + deterministic: a per-repo spawn is bounded; any failure skips
//     that repo and the hook always exits cleanly (Stop hooks must not hang).
//   - Skipped entirely during a cascade (`FLEET_SYNC`) or a history squash
//     (`SQUASH_HISTORY`) — those own their own commits.
//
// A session that sees a commit it didn't personally issue should recognize it as
// this auto-lander (see docs/agents.md/fleet/parallel-claude-sessions.md ->
// "Auto-landed commits are expected"), not a rival — run `whose-work` to confirm.
