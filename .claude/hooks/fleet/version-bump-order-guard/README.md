# version-bump-order-guard

PreToolUse hook that blocks `git tag vX.Y.Z` when HEAD isn't a bump commit **or** the tree fails the fast pre-release gate. Enforces steps 1, 3, and 4 of CLAUDE.md's "Version bumps" rule.

## What it catches

- `git tag v1.2.3` (or `git tag -a v…`, `git tag -s v…`) when the most-recent commit subject doesn't match `chore: bump version to X.Y.Z` or `chore(scope): release X.Y.Z`.
- A version tag whose tree fails `pnpm run lint --all` (the exact command CI's Check job runs) — accumulated lint debt that CI will reject.
- A version tag whose tree has open `pnpm audit` advisories — a release carrying known-vulnerable dependencies.

## Why

The bump commit must be the LAST commit on the release. Tagging on a non-bump commit produces a broken release: `git describe` lies, bisecting past the tag lands on a different state, and the changelog drifts from the artifact.

The gate half front-runs the two pre-release checks cheap enough to run synchronously. **Why:** 2026-06-01 socket-lib tagged v6.0.7 while a cascade had escalated ~10 socket lint rules to `error` without bringing the code into compliance — 1144 lint errors and 2 moderate advisories shipped past the local steps and only surfaced when CI's Check job failed post-tag. The slow half of the gate (`pnpm run check --all` — typecheck, unit tests, coverage) stays in CI.

## Bypass

- Type `Allow version-bump-order bypass` in a recent user message (also accepts `Allow version bump order bypass` / `Allow versionbumporder bypass`), or
- Set `SOCKET_VERSION_BUMP_SKIP_GATE=1` (gate half only — when the gate is being run out-of-band but ordering is fine).

## Test

```sh
pnpm test
```
