// Claude Code Stop hook — human-gate-ends-turn-guard.
//
// A rendered 🖐 HUMAN GATE means the flow is BLOCKED on something only the
// operator can clear. The gate must therefore be the LAST thing in the reply.
//
// Why this blocks instead of nudging: a gate that scrolls off the bottom is a
// gate the operator does not act on. Appending status, a `<details>` recap, or
// "meanwhile I also did X" after the gate buries the one line that needs a
// human, and it reads as though the work continued past the block, which is
// the opposite of what a gate asserts. The operator's instruction was direct:
// "if there is a human gate you need to stop after the gate and not keep
// pushing text".
//
// Scope: the LAST gate in the reply. A numbered queue (`[1/3]`, `[2/3]`, …)
// renders several gates together and prose between them is part of the queue,
// so only trailing content after the final `Me:` line is judged.
//
// A closing code fence is allowed, because the fleet renders gates inside a
// fenced block so the operator can copy lane A verbatim. Fences are NOT
// stripped before scanning: that would erase the gate itself.
//
// Naturally quiet once the gate is answered. `readLastAssistantTurnText` reads
// only the entries after the most recent user turn, so once the operator
// replies the gate is no longer in the scanned text and follow-up work is free
// to narrate itself.
//
// No bypass: move the trailing text above the gate, or cut it.
