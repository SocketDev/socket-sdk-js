// Claude Code PreToolUse hook — reserved-script-dir-guard.
//
// Blocks Edit/Write that create a file under a `scripts/<reserved>/` dir
// whose name collides with a build / output / tooling concept. `scripts/`
// holds two canonical tiers — `scripts/fleet/` (wheelhouse-canonical) and
// `scripts/repo/` (repo-owned) — plus feature dirs named for what they do.
// A dir called `build`, `dist`, `node_modules`, `coverage`, or `cache`
// overloads a reserved meaning (build is a lifecycle script + `dist/` is the
// output; `node_modules`/`cache` are install/tool dirs) and reads ambiguously.
//
// Incident: 2026-06-03 socket-lib had `scripts/build/` whose `cli.mts` was the
// rolldown build runner — `build` collides with the `build` package.json
// script + the `dist/` output + `scripts/build-externals/`. Renamed to
// `scripts/bundle/`. This guard stops the pattern recurring at edit time.
//
// Allowed: scripts/fleet/**, scripts/repo/**, scripts/_*/** (internals), and
// any feature dir NOT in the reserved set (e.g. scripts/bundle/, scripts/post-
// build/ — note `post-build` is not reserved, only the bare `build`).
//
// Blocked: scripts/build/**, scripts/dist/**, scripts/node_modules/**,
// scripts/coverage/**, scripts/cache/**.
//
// Bypass: `Allow reserved-script-dir bypass` in a recent user turn.
//
// Exit codes: 0 — pass; 2 — block. Fails open on any throw.
