/*
 * @file Tell a real opt-out marker from a MENTION of one.
 *
 *   `// oxlint-disable-next-line socket/no-console-prefer-logger` in a comment is a marker. The same text
 *   inside a string literal is documentation — a guard's help text, a rule's
 *   error message, a doc example. A regex cannot separate them, and that one
 *   confusion has now broken three separate efforts:
 *
 *     - the bypass-marker audit reported ~40 live suppressions as deletable,
 *       every hit being marker syntax quoted in a guard's own help text;
 *     - a second pass, narrowed to scanner-backed rules, was still 100% wrong
 *       for the same reason;
 *     - the migration to oxlint's grammar rewrote a sentence inside an
 *       AI-guidance string, and picked the wrong directive doing it, because a
 *       mid-string match reads as a trailing marker.
 *
 *   So: parse, and count a marker only when it lives in a COMMENT node. This is
 *   the shared primitive both the audit and the migration are blocked on.
 *
 *   Fail-closed. A file that will not parse reports `parsed: false` with no
 *   sites, never an empty list that reads as "no markers here" — the same
 *   blindness-is-not-absence rule the retirement sweep follows.
