/*
 * @file Shell-command parsing for Bash-allowlist hooks. Wraps `shell-quote` (a
 *   maintained, zero-dep JS tokenizer) so structure-sensitive guards can reason
 *   about "what binary actually runs, at each command position" instead of
 *   regex-matching the raw string. Why this exists: regex command detection is
 *   evaded by ordinary shell indirection — `g=git; $g push`, `eval "git push"`,
 *   `git $(printf push)`, `\git push`. CLAUDE.md ("Background Bash") mandates
 *   AST-based parsing for structure-sensitive Bash rules; this is the fleet's
 *   JS parser layer, built on `shell-quote` (the fleet-canonical shell parser).
 *   What it gives you:
 *
 *   - `parseCommands(command)` — split a command line into Command segments, one
 *     per shell command (separated by `;`, `&&`, `||`, `|`, `&`, and the
 *     boundaries of `$(…)` substitutions). Each segment carries its binary,
 *     args, leading `VAR=val` assignments, and indirection flags.
 *   - `findInvocation(command, { binary, subcommand })` — true when any segment
 *     invokes `binary` (optionally with `subcommand` as its first non-flag
 *     argument). Sees through chains, substitution, and quoting.
 *   - Each Command exposes `viaVariable` (binary resolved from `$VAR` →
 *     shell-quote yields an empty binary token) and `viaEval` (the binary is
 *     `eval`), so a guard can choose to BLOCK or fail-loud on indirection it
 *     can't statically resolve rather than silently allow it. Limitation:
 *     shell-quote tokenizes, it doesn't fully evaluate. It cannot expand a
 *     variable's value (`g=git; $g push` yields an empty binary, not `git`) —
 *     but it FLAGS that the binary was variable-sourced, which is the
 *     actionable signal. Aliases defined elsewhere and wrapper scripts remain
 *     out of scope for any static parser.
