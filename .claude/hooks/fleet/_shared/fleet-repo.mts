/**
 * @file Detect whether an edited file belongs to a FLEET-MANAGED repo. Fleet
 *   edit-time guards that merely mirror a fleet LINT RULE (logger over
 *   console, function declarations over arrow consts, `import type`, …) must
 *   not fire on a non-fleet sibling repo: those repos run their own toolchain
 *   (biome, eslint, whatever) and the fleet conventions simply don't apply
 *   there, so a fleet session editing a non-fleet repo would otherwise demand
 *   `socket-lint` opt-out comments in code that isn't fleet-linted at all.
 *   A repo is fleet-managed iff its root carries `.config/fleet/` (the cascaded
 *   fleet oxlint/oxfmt config tree — present in every fleet member, absent in
 *   non-fleet repos). Detection walks up from the file to the first `.git`
 *   repo root.
 *   FAIL-SAFE: when the repo can't be determined (no `.git` found before the
 *   filesystem root), assume fleet-managed so a guard keeps enforcing rather
 *   than silently going quiet. Security / safety guards (secret content,
 *   personal paths, git-state) must NOT use this — they apply everywhere, so
 *   they don't opt into the fleet-only skip.
