/**
 * @file The universal fleet environment knobs — the fail-closed
 *   no-phone-home / no-telemetry posture set on EVERY platform and surface:
 *   dev shell-rc (setup-security-tools), CI (the reusable workflow `env:`), and
 *   spawned AI agents (`spawnAiAgent` child env). Single source of truth — the
 *   shell-rc bridge, the CI workflow env, and `telemetry-env-is-disabled.mts`
 *   all derive from THIS list so they can't diverge.
 *
 *   Distinct from the macOS-only knobs (`HOMEBREW_*` in
 *   `package-manager-auto-update.mts` / `brew-supply-chain.mts`): those are
 *   platform-gated. These are cross-platform. `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER` lives here
 *   (not the macOS list) precisely because npm/pnpm honor it on every OS —
 *   scoping it to macOS is why CI runners never had it and the
 *   package-manager-auto-update gate failed in CI.
 *
 *   Listed alphabetically by name (fleet `socket/sort-*` convention).
