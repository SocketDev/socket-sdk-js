     * Get Packages by PURL
     * @description Batch retrieval of package metadata and alerts by PURL strings. Compatible witch CycloneDX reports.
     *
     * Package URLs (PURLs) are an ecosystem agnostic way to identify packages.
     * CycloneDX SBOMs use the purl format to identify components.
     * This endpoint supports fetching metadata and alerts for multiple packages at once by passing an array of purl strings, or by passing an entire CycloneDX report.
     *
     * More information on purl and CycloneDX:
     *
     * - [`purl` Spec](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec)
     * - [CycloneDX Spec](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/#components)
     *
     * This endpoint returns the latest available alert data for artifacts in the batch (stale while revalidate).
     * Actively running analysis will be returned when available on subsequent runs.
     *
     * ## Examples:
     *
     * ### Looking up an npm package:
     *
     * ```json
     * {
     *   "components": [
     *     {
     *       "purl": "pkg:npm/express@4.19.2"
     *     }
     *   ]
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ### Looking up an PyPi package:
     *
     * ```json
     * {
     *   "components": [
     *     {
     *       "purl": "pkg:pypi/django@5.0.6"
     *     }
     *   ]
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ### Looking up a Maven package:
     *
     * ```json
     * {
     *   "components": [
     *     {
     *       "purl": "pkg:maven/log4j/log4j@1.2.17"
     *     }
     *   ]
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ### Batch lookup
     *
     * ```json
     * {
     *   "components": [
     *     {
     *       "purl": "pkg:npm/express@4.19.2"
     *     },
     *     {

     *
     * ## PURLs
     *
     * Users may also modify their license policy's allow and warn lists by using [package URLs](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) (aka PURLs), which support glob patterns to allow a range of versions, files and directories, etc.
     *
     * purl qualifiers which support globs are `filename`, `version_glob`, `artifact_id` and `license_provenance` (primarily used for allowing data from registry metadata).
     *
     * ### Examples:
     * Allow all license data found in a specific version of a package 4.14.1: `pkg:npm/lodash@4.14.1`
     * Allow all license data found in a version range of a package: `pkg:npm/lodash?version_glob=15.*`
     * Allow all license data in the test directory of a given package for certain version ranges: `pkg:npm/lodash@15.*.*?file_name=lodash/test/*`
     * Allow all license data taken from the package registry for a package and version range: `pkg:npm/lodash?version_glob=*&license_provenance=registry_metadata`
     *
     * ## Available options
     *
     * `toplevelOnly`: only apply the license policy to "top level" license data in a package, which includes registry metadata, LICENSE files, and manifest files which are closest to the root of the package.
     *
     * `applyToUnidentified`: Apply license policy to found but unidentified license data. If enabled, the license policy will be applied to license data which could not be affirmatively identified as a known license (this will effectively merge the license policy violation and unidentified license alerts). If disabled, license policy alerts will only be shown for license data which is positively identified as something not allowed or set to warn by the license policy.

     *
     *
     *     ## Return value
     *
     *     For each requested PURL, an array is returned. Each array contains a list of license policy violations
     *     detected for the requested PURL.
     *
     *     Violations are accompanied by a string identifying the offending license data as `spdxAtomOrExtraData`,
     *     a message describing why the license data is believed to be incompatible with the license policy, and a list
     *     of locations (by filepath or other provenance information) where the offending license data may be found.
     *
     *     ```json
     *     Array<
     *       Array<{
     *         filepathOrProvenance: Array<string>,
     *         level: "warning" | "violation",

     *   allow?: Array<string>
     *   warn?: Array<string>
     *   options?: Array<string>
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Elements of the `allow` and `warn` arrays strings representing items which should be allowed, or which should trigger a warning; license data found in package which not present in either array will produce a license violation (effectively a "hard" error). For example, to allow Apache-2.0 and MIT to the allow list, simply add the strings "Apache-2.0" and "MIT" to the `allow` array. Strings appearing in these arrays are generally "what you see is what you get", with two important exceptions: strings which are recognized as license classes and strings which are recognized as PURLs are handled differently to allow for more flexible license policy creation.
     *
     * ## License Classes
     *
     * Strings which are license classes will expand to a list of licenses known to be in that particular license class. Recognized license classes are:
     *   'permissive',
     *   'permissive (model)',
     *   'permissive (gold)',
     *   'permissive (silver)',
     *   'permissive (bronze)',
     *   'permissive (lead)',
     *   'copyleft',
     *   'maximal copyleft',
     *   'network copyleft',
     *   'strong copyleft',
     *   'weak copyleft',
     *   'contributor license agreement',
     *   'public domain',

For example, to allow Apache-2.0 and MIT to the allow list, simply add the strings "Apache-2.0" and "MIT" to the `allow` array. Strings appearing in these arrays are generally "what you see is what you get", with two important exceptions: strings which are recognized as license classes and strings which are recognized as PURLs are handled differently to allow for more flexible license policy creation.
     *
     * ## License Classes
     *
     * Strings which are license classes will expand to a list of licenses known to be in that particular license class. Recognized license classes are:
     *   'permissive',
     *   'permissive (model)',
     *   'permissive (gold)',
     *   'permissive (silver)',
     *   'permissive (bronze)',
     *   'permissive (lead)',
     *   'copyleft',
     *   'maximal copyleft',
     *   'network copyleft',
     *   'strong copyleft',
     *   'weak copyleft',
     *   'contributor license agreement',
     *   'public domain',
     *   'proprietary free',
     *   'source available',
     *   'proprietary',
     *   'commercial',
     *   'patent'
     *
     * Users can learn more about [copyleft tiers](https://blueoakcouncil.org/copyleft) and [permissive tiers](https://blueoakcouncil.org/list) by reading the linked resources.
     *
     *
     * ## PURLs
     *
     * Users may also modify their license policy's allow and warn lists by using [package URLs](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) (aka PURLs), which support glob patterns to allow a range of versions, files and directories, etc.
     *
     * purl qualifiers which support globs are `filename`, `version_glob`, `artifact_id` and `license_provenance` (primarily used for allowing data from registry metadata).
     *
     * ### Examples:
     * Allow all license data found in a specific version of a package 4.14.1: `pkg:npm/lodash@4.14.1`
     * Allow all license data found in a version range of a package: `pkg:npm/lodash?version_glob=15.*`
     * Allow all license data in the test directory of a given package for certain version ranges: `pkg:npm/lodash@15.*.*?file_name=lodash/test/*`
     * Allow all license data taken from the package registry for a package and version range: `pkg:npm/lodash?version_glob=*&license_provenance=registry_metadata`
     *
     * ## Available options
     *
     * `toplevelOnly`: only apply the license policy to "top level" license data in a package, which includes registry metadata, LICENSE files, and manifest files which are closest to the root of the package.
     *
     * `applyToUnidentified`: Apply license policy to found but unidentified license data. If enabled, the license policy will be applied to license data which could not be affirmatively identified as a known license (this will effectively merge the license policy violation and unidentified license alerts). If disabled, license policy alerts will only be shown for license data which is positively identified as something not allowed or set to warn by the license policy.

   * Get Packages by PURL
   * @description Batch retrieval of package metadata and alerts by PURL strings. Compatible witch CycloneDX reports.
   *
   * Package URLs (PURLs) are an ecosystem agnostic way to identify packages.
   * CycloneDX SBOMs use the purl format to identify components.
   * This endpoint supports fetching metadata and alerts for multiple packages at once by passing an array of purl strings, or by passing an entire CycloneDX report.
   *
   * More information on purl and CycloneDX:
   *
   * - [`purl` Spec](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec)
   * - [CycloneDX Spec](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/#components)
   *
   * This endpoint returns the latest available alert data for artifacts in the batch (stale while revalidate).
   * Actively running analysis will be returned when available on subsequent runs.

   * ## Examples:
   *
   * ### Looking up an npm package:
   *

   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * ### Looking up an PyPi package:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "components": [
   *     {
   *       "purl": "pkg:pypi/django@5.0.6"
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * ### Looking up a Maven package:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "components": [
   *     {
   *       "purl": "pkg:maven/log4j/log4j@1.2.17"
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * ### Batch lookup

   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   allow?: Array<string>
   *   warn?: Array<string>
   *   options?: Array<string>
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Elements of the `allow` and `warn` arrays strings representing items which should be allowed, or which should trigger a warning; license data found in package which not present in either array will produce a license violation (effectively a "hard" error). For example, to allow Apache-2.0 and MIT to the allow list, simply add the strings "Apache-2.0" and "MIT" to the `allow` array. Strings appearing in these arrays are generally "what you see is what you get", with two important exceptions: strings which are recognized as license classes and strings which are recognized as PURLs are handled differently to allow for more flexible license policy creation.
   *
   * ## License Classes
   *
   * Strings which are license classes will expand to a list of licenses known to be in that particular license class. Recognized license classes are:
   *   'permissive',
   *   'permissive (model)',
   *   'permissive (gold)',
   *   'permissive (silver)',
   *   'permissive (bronze)',
   *   'permissive (lead)',
   *   'copyleft',
   *   'maximal copyleft',
   *   'network copyleft',
   *   'strong copyleft',
   *   'weak copyleft',
   *   'contributor license agreement',
   *   'public domain',
   *   'proprietary free',
   *   'source available',
   *   'proprietary',
   *   'commercial',
   *   'patent'
   *
   * Users can learn more about [copyleft tiers](https://blueoakcouncil.org/copyleft) and [permissive tiers](https://blueoakcouncil.org/list) by reading the linked resources.
   *
   *
   * ## PURLs
   *
   * Users may also modify their license policy's allow and warn lists by using [package URLs](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) (aka PURLs), which support glob patterns to allow a range of versions, files and directories, etc.
   *
   * purl qualifiers which support globs are `filename`, `version_glob`, `artifact_id` and `license_provenance` (primarily used for allowing data from registry metadata).
   *
   * ### Examples:
   * Allow all license data found in a specific version of a package 4.14.1: `pkg:npm/lodash@4.14.1`
   * Allow all license data found in a version range of a package: `pkg:npm/lodash?version_glob=15.*`
   * Allow all license data in the test directory of a given package for certain version ranges: `pkg:npm/lodash@15.*.*?file_name=lodash/test/*`
   * Allow all license data taken from the package registry for a package and version range: `pkg:npm/lodash?version_glob=*&license_provenance=registry_metadata`
   *
   * ## Available options
   *
   * `toplevelOnly`: only apply the license policy to "top level" license data in a package, which includes registry metadata, LICENSE files, and manifest files which are closest to the root of the package.
   *
   * `applyToUnidentified`: Apply license policy to found but unidentified license data. If enabled, the license policy will be applied to license data which could not be affirmatively identified as a known license (this will effectively merge the license policy violation and unidentified license alerts). If disabled, license policy alerts will only be shown for license data which is positively identified as something not allowed or set to warn by the license policy.

  /**
   * License Policy (Beta)
   * @description Compare the license data found for a list of packages (given as PURL strings) with the contents of a configurable license policy,
   *     returning information about license data which does not comply with the license allow list.
   *
   *     ## Example request body:
   *
   *     ```json
   *     {
   *       "components": [
   *         {
   *           "purl": "pkg:npm/lodash@4.17.21"
   *         },
   *         {
   *           "purl": "pkg:npm/lodash@4.14.1"
   *         }
   *       ],
   *       "allow": [
   *         "permissive",
   *         "pkg:npm/lodash?file_name=foo/test/*&version_glob=4.17.*"
   *       ],
   *       "warn": [
   *         "copyleft",
   *         "pkg:npm/lodash?file_name=foo/prod/*&version_glob=4.14.*"
   *       ],
   *       "options": ["toplevelOnly"]
   *     }
   *     ```
   *
   *
   *     ## Return value
   *
   *     For each requested PURL, an array is returned. Each array contains a list of license policy violations
   *     detected for the requested PURL.
   *
   *     Violations are accompanied by a string identifying the offending license data as `spdxAtomOrExtraData`,
   *     a message describing why the license data is believed to be incompatible with the license policy, and a list
   *     of locations (by filepath or other provenance information) where the offending license data may be found.
   *
   *     ```json
   *     Array<
   *       Array<{
   *         filepathOrProvenance: Array<string>,
   *         level: "warning" | "violation",
   *         purl: string,
   *         spdxAtomOrExtraData: string,
   *         violationExplanation: string
   *       }>
   *     >
   *     ```
   *
   *     ## License policy schema
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   allow?: Array<string>
   *   warn?: Array<string>
   *   options?: Array<string>
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Elements of the `allow` and `warn` arrays strings representing items which should be allowed, or which should trigger a warning; license data found in package which not present in either array will produce a license violation (effectively a "hard" error). For example, to allow Apache-2.0 and MIT to the allow list, simply add the strings "Apache-2.0" and "MIT" to the `allow` array. Strings appearing in these arrays are generally "what you see is what you get", with two important exceptions: strings which are recognized as license classes and strings which are recognized as PURLs are handled differently to allow for more flexible license policy creation.
   *
   * ## License Classes
   *
   * Strings which are license classes will expand to a list of licenses known to be in that particular license class. Recognized license classes are:
   *   'permissive',
   *   'permissive (model)',
   *   'permissive (gold)',
   *   'permissive (silver)',
   *   'permissive (bronze)',
   *   'permissive (lead)',
   *   'copyleft',
   *   'maximal copyleft',
   *   'network copyleft',
   *   'strong copyleft',
   *   'weak copyleft',
   *   'contributor license agreement',
   *   'public domain',
   *   'proprietary free',
   *   'source available',
   *   'proprietary',
   *   'commercial',
   *   'patent'
   *
   * Users can learn more about [copyleft tiers](https://blueoakcouncil.org/copyleft) and [permissive tiers](https://blueoakcouncil.org/list) by reading the linked resources.
   *
   *
   * ## PURLs
   *
   * Users may also modify their license policy's allow and warn lists by using [package URLs](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) (aka PURLs), which support glob patterns to allow a range of versions, files and directories, etc.
   *
   * purl qualifiers which support globs are `filename`, `version_glob`, `artifact_id` and `license_provenance` (primarily used for allowing data from registry metadata).
   *
   * ### Examples:
   * Allow all license data found in a specific version of a package 4.14.1: `pkg:npm/lodash@4.14.1`
   * Allow all license data found in a version range of a package: `pkg:npm/lodash?version_glob=15.*`
   * Allow all license data in the test directory of a given package for certain version ranges: `pkg:npm/lodash@15.*.*?file_name=lodash/test/*`
   * Allow all license data taken from the package registry for a package and version range: `pkg:npm/lodash?version_glob=*&license_provenance=registry_metadata`
   *
   * ## Available options
   *
   * `toplevelOnly`: only apply the license policy to "top level" license data in a package, which includes registry metadata, LICENSE files, and manifest files which are closest to the root of the package.
   *
   * `applyToUnidentified`: Apply license policy to found but unidentified license data. If enabled, the license policy will be applied to license data which could not be affirmatively identified as a known license (this will effectively merge the license policy violation and unidentified license alerts). If disabled, license policy alerts will only be shown for license data which is positively identified as something not allowed or set to warn by the license policy.

   * Saturate License Policy (Legacy)
   * @deprecated
   * @description **This endpoint is deprecated.** Use the [successor version](https://docs.socket.dev/reference/updateorglicensepolicy) instead.
   *
   * Get the "saturated" version of a license policy's allow list, filling in the entire set of allowed
   * license data. For example, the saturated form of a license allow list which only specifies that
   * licenses in the tier "maximal copyleft" are allowed is shown below (note the expanded `allowedStrings` property):
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "allowedApprovalSources": [],
   *   "allowedFamilies": [],
   *   "allowedTiers": [
   *     "maximal copyleft"

   *
   * This may be helpful for users who want to compose more complex sets of allowed license data via
   * the "allowedStrings" property, or for users who want to know more about the contents of a particular

   * CopyleftTier ::= "maximal copyleft" | "network copyleft" | "strong copyleft" | "weak copyleft"
   *
   * ## Return Value
   *
   * The returned value has the same shape as a license allow list:
   *
   * ```json

   *
   *
   *     ## Example request body:
   *

   *     [
   *       "Apache-2.0",
   *       "BSD Zero Clause License"

   *

   *     // Response schema:
   *     Array<{
   *       licenseId: string,
   *       name?: string,
   *       deprecated?: string,
   *       crossref?: string
   *       classes: Array<string>
   *       text?: string
   *     }>
   *
   *     // Example response:
   *     [
   *       {
   *         "licenseId": "Apache-2.0",
   *         "name": "Apache License 2.0",
   *         "deprecated": false,
   *         "crossref": "https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html",
   *         "classes": [
   *           "fsf libre",
   *           "osi approved",
   *           "permissive (silver)"
   *         ]
   *       },
   *       {
   *         "licenseId": "0BSD",

   *         "classes": [
   *           "osi approved",
   *           "permissive (bronze)"
   *         ]
   *       }
   *     ]
   *     ```
   *
   *     ## License policy schema
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   allow?: Array<string>
   *   warn?: Array<string>
   *   options?: Array<string>
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Elements of the `allow` and `warn` arrays strings representing items which should be allowed, or which should trigger a warning; license data found in package which not present in either array will produce a license violation (effectively a "hard" error). For example, to allow Apache-2.0 and MIT to the allow list, simply add the strings "Apache-2.0" and "MIT" to the `allow` array. Strings appearing in these arrays are generally "what you see is what you get", with two important exceptions: strings which are recognized as license classes and strings which are recognized as PURLs are handled differently to allow for more flexible license policy creation.
   *
   * ## License Classes
   *
   * Strings which are license classes will expand to a list of licenses known to be in that particular license class. Recognized license classes are:
   *   'permissive',
   *   'permissive (model)',
   *   'permissive (gold)',
   *   'permissive (silver)',
   *   'permissive (bronze)',
   *   'permissive (lead)',
   *   'copyleft',
   *   'maximal copyleft',
   *   'network copyleft',
   *   'strong copyleft',
   *   'weak copyleft',
   *   'contributor license agreement',
   *   'public domain',
   *   'proprietary free',
   *   'source available',
   *   'proprietary',
   *   'commercial',
   *   'patent'
   *
   * Users can learn more about [copyleft tiers](https://blueoakcouncil.org/copyleft) and [permissive tiers](https://blueoakcouncil.org/list) by reading the linked resources.
   *
   *
   * ## PURLs
   *
   * Users may also modify their license policy's allow and warn lists by using [package URLs](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) (aka PURLs), which support glob patterns to allow a range of versions, files and directories, etc.
   *
   * purl qualifiers which support globs are `filename`, `version_glob`, `artifact_id` and `license_provenance` (primarily used for allowing data from registry metadata).
   *
   * ### Examples:
   * Allow all license data found in a specific version of a package 4.14.1: `pkg:npm/lodash@4.14.1`
   * Allow all license data found in a version range of a package: `pkg:npm/lodash?version_glob=15.*`
   * Allow all license data in the test directory of a given package for certain version ranges: `pkg:npm/lodash@15.*.*?file_name=lodash/test/*`
   * Allow all license data taken from the package registry for a package and version range: `pkg:npm/lodash?version_glob=*&license_provenance=registry_metadata`
   *
   * ## Available options
   *
   * `toplevelOnly`: only apply the license policy to "top level" license data in a package, which includes registry metadata, LICENSE files, and manifest files which are closest to the root of the package.
   *
   * `applyToUnidentified`: Apply license policy to found but unidentified license data. If enabled, the license policy will be applied to license data which could not be affirmatively identified as a known license (this will effectively merge the license policy violation and unidentified license alerts). If disabled, license policy alerts will only be shown for license data which is positively identified as something not allowed or set to warn by the license policy.
